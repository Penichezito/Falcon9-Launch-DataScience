# Data Collection

This project focuses on predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings using machine learning. A crucial initial step is the data collection process, which involves retrieving and organizing relevant data about past Falcon 9 launches.

### Data Source

The primary data source for this project is the SpaceX API. This API provides comprehensive information about various aspects of SpaceX missions, including launch details, rocket specifications, payload data, and more. For demonstration purposes, the notebook utilizes a static JSON file containing launch data, but the code can be easily modified to fetch data directly from the API.

### Data Extraction Process

The data collection stage involves a series of steps to retrieve and process the necessary information:

1. **API Interaction:** The code initiates by making requests to the SpaceX API using the `requests` library. It fetches data on past Falcon 9 launches.

2. **Helper Functions:** Four helper functions play a crucial role in extracting specific details from the API responses:
    - `getBoosterVersion`: Extracts the booster version (e.g., Falcon 9 Block 5) associated with a launch.
    - `getLaunchSite`: Retrieves information about the launch site, including its name, longitude, and latitude.
    - `getPayloadData`: Extracts data about the payload, such as its mass and the target orbit.
    - `getCoreData`: Gathers information about the rocket core, including landing outcomes, reuse status, and other relevant details.

3. **Data Parsing and Transformation:** The JSON responses from the API are parsed and converted into a Pandas DataFrame, providing a structured tabular representation of the data. This DataFrame undergoes further transformations, such as:
    - Filtering for Falcon 9 launches: The data is filtered to focus solely on Falcon 9 launches, excluding other rocket types like Falcon Heavy.
    - Feature selection: Relevant features for predicting landing success are selected from the DataFrame, including booster version, payload mass, launch site details, core landing outcomes, and more.
    - Data cleaning: The data is cleaned by handling missing values, converting data types (e.g., dates), and ensuring data consistency.

4. **Iterative Data Enrichment:** The helper functions are used iteratively to extract detailed information about each launch based on unique identifiers within the dataset. This process enriches the data with more specific details about the booster, launch site, payload, and core.

5. **DataFrame Construction:** Finally, the extracted data is organized into a dictionary and converted into a final Pandas DataFrame. This DataFrame contains a comprehensive collection of features relevant to predicting Falcon 9 first stage landing success.


### Data Attributes

The collected data includes various attributes relevant to the task, such as:

- `FlightNumber`: Unique identifier for each launch.
- `Date`: Date of the launch.
- `BoosterVersion`: Version of the Falcon 9 booster used.
- `PayloadMass`: Mass of the payload carried by the rocket.
- `Orbit`: Target orbit for the payload.
- `LaunchSite`: Location of the launch site.
- `Outcome`: Outcome of the core landing (success or failure).
- `Flights`: Number of flights the core has completed.
- `GridFins`: Whether grid fins were used during landing.
- `Reused`: Whether the core was previously reused.
- `Legs`: Whether landing legs were used.
- `LandingPad`: Identifier of the landing pad used.
- `Block`: Block version of the core.
- `ReusedCount`: Number of times the core has been reused.
- `Serial`: Serial number of the core.
- `Longitude`: Longitude of the launch site.
- `Latitude`: Latitude of the launch site.

### Data Storage

The final dataset is saved as a CSV file named `dataset_part_1.csv`. This file serves as the foundation for subsequent data wrangling, feature engineering, and model development stages.
